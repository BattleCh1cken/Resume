	{\footnotesize

	Junior in High School with an interest in Computer Science. Currently looking for internship/research opportunities. I am available for summer 2023 as well as the coming 2023-2024 school year.

	\bg{cvgreen}{white}{Interests}\\[0.5em]

	I love building things, hardware and software. In my free time I do things like 3d-printing, and contributing to open source projects. I also love fine tuning my setup, though both hardware and software, finding the perfect tools for the job, whether it be a perfectly tuned window manager, or a hand sautered mechanical keyboard.
